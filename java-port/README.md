# Java Port (LWJGL)

This folder is the start of a Java + LWJGL rewrite of the current Python/Ursina voxel game.

## Run

Prereqs:
- Java 17+
- Gradle (or use IntelliJ which can import and run Gradle projects)

From this folder:

```bash
gradle run
```

## Assets

This project loads textures directly from the existing workspace `textures/` folder.
So you can keep your current materials without copying.
